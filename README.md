## Installation

Laravel Manager requires [PHP](https://php.net) 7.1-7.4. This particular version supports Laravel 5.5-5.8 and 6 only.

To get the latest version, simply require the project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
$ composer require graham-campbell/manager
```

Once installed, you can extend or implement the classes in this package to speed up writing Laravel packages further. There are no service providers to register.


## Configuration

Laravel Manager requires no configuration. Just follow the simple install instructions and go!


## Usage

##### ConnectorInterface

This interface defines one public method.

The `'connect'` method accepts one parameter which is an array of config.

This interface is not used by this package, but is used by [Laravel Flysystem](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Flysystem).

##### ManagerInterface

This interface defines the public methods a manager class must implement.

The `'connection'` method accepts one optional parameter (the connection name), and will return a connection instance and will reuse a previous connection from the pool if possible.

The `'reconnect'` method accepts one optional parameter (the connection name), and will return a connection instance after forcing a re-connect.

The `'disconnect'` method accepts one optional parameter (the connection name), and will return nothing after removing the connection from the pool.

The `'getConnectionConfig'` method has one required parameter (the connection name), and will return the config for the specified connection.

The `'getDefaultConnection'` method will return the default connection as specified in the config.

The `'setDefaultConnection'` method has one required parameter (the connection name), and will return nothing after setting the default connection.

The `'extend'` method has two required parameter. The first is the name of a connection, or the name of a connection driver. The second parameter must be `callable`. The purpose of this method is to add custom connection creation methods on the fly. The second parameter must return a connection.

The `'getConnections'` method will return an array of all the connections currently in the pool.

##### AbstractManager

This abstract class implements the `ManagerInterface`. It has two abstract protected methods that must be implemented by extending classes.

The `'createConnection'` method will be called with the specific connection config as the first parameter. It must return a connection instance.

The `'getConfigName'` method must return the name of the connection config. This may be `'yourname\yourpackage'` for example.

You can also dynamically call methods on the default connection due to the use of `__call` so instead of writing `->connection()->methodName()`, you can just jump straight in with `->methodName()`.

##### Further Information

You may see an example of implementation in [Laravel Flysystem](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Flysystem), [Laravel DigitalOcean](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-DigitalOcean), and [Laravel GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub).
